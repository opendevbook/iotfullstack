# 4 What's RPC control?

ThingsBoard RPC (Remote Procedure Call) control allows you to send commands from the ThingsBoard server to a device, which is especially useful for controlling connected devices. Here's how to set up and handle RPC commands on ThingsBoard and the ESP32 device.

esp32 have to subcript on topic **v1/devices/me/rpc/request/+**

!!! note "what is + sign in topic"

    + symbol is a wildcard character used in topics to match a single level in the topic hierarchy. It allows a subscriber to listen to multiple topics with similar structures by replacing one level in the topic hierarchy with +

    For example, given these topics:

    home/livingroom/temperature
    home/kitchen/temperature
    home/bedroom/temperature

    Examples of + Usage
    Topic Matching:

        sensors/+/humidity would match:
        sensors/livingroom/humidity
        sensors/bedroom/humidity

    But it would not match sensors/humidity (because + requires exactly one level to match).
    Multi-level Matching:

        sensors/+/temperature would match any temperature readings from one level below sensors/, but only if thereâ€™s exactly one additional level.

## Lab1 Send RPC control from dashboard

- Create Dashboard for esp32 device
  ![](../assets/images/rpc2.png)

- Create Dashboard "muict-dashboard"
  ![](../assets/images/dashboard1.png)

- Add widget to dasboard  
  ![](../assets/images/dashboard2.png)

- Select Control widget
  ![](../assets/images/dashboard3.png)

- Select Single Button
  ![](../assets/images/dashboard4.png)

- Select Device muict_esp32 , add click add
  ![](../assets/images/dashboard5.png)

- Check result in arduino ide terminal
  ![](../assets/images/dashboard6.png)

- try to click swich for 2-3 times and see result

!!! note ""

    request id will incliment by one
        v1/devices/me/rpc/request/1
        v1/devices/me/rpc/request/2
        v1/devices/me/rpc/request/3

## Lab2 Send RPC from python

create python environment

```
mkdir muict-iot-lab
cd muict-iot-lab
python3 -m venv venv

venv\Script\activate    (windows)
source venv/bin/activate
```
